## Why SketchForge

SketchForge is a lightweight CAD-style workspace for people who want to sketch, cut, and export 3D models quickly.

It is built for the satisfying loop: drop a shape, resize it, rotate it, make another shape a hole, group the result, import an STL if primitives are not enough, and export the finished model.

No login. No server project storage. No heavyweight CAD install just to make a useful part.

## What It Does

- **Local-first projects** - designs live in browser storage with generated project thumbnails.
- **Real 3D workplane** - grid, camera controls, snap settings, transform handles, outlines, and inspector controls.
- **Primitive shape library** - boxes, cylinders, spheres, cones, pyramids, wedges, text, roofs, half spheres, torus shapes, tubes, and more.
- **Solid and hole workflow** - turn shapes into cutters and group them into final geometry.
- **Boolean Intersection** - keep only the geometry where selected solid and hole shapes overlap.
- **STL import** - bring outside models into the same workspace as primitives.
- **STL and OBJ export** - export selected objects or the whole scene.
- **AI scene bridge (MCP)** - drive the editor from Claude: an MCP server pushes parametric scenes into the live workplane. See [AI Scene Bridge (MCP)](#ai-scene-bridge-mcp).
- **Fast browser stack** - Next.js, React, TypeScript, Three.js, and Manifold/CSG geometry tooling.

## Demo

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

## Docker / FabLab Server (Recommended)

The Docker image contains a static SketchForge build served by Nginx. Projects stay in each user's browser; STL and OBJ files download through that browser. The container does not receive or store project files.

Docker is the recommended server setup because it packages the correct Node build environment, static app, Nginx configuration, health check, and restart policy together. It is easier to reproduce and update than configuring each part by hand.

Requirements:

- Docker Engine with Docker Compose

Build and start SketchForge:

```bash
npm run docker:up
```

Open it on the server:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

Other computers on the same network can use the server's LAN address:

```text
http://SERVER_IP:3000/
```

To use another host port:

```bash
SKETCHFORGE_PORT=8080 npm run docker:up
```

On PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:SKETCHFORGE_PORT = "8080"
npm run docker:up
```

Stop the server with:

```bash
npm run docker:down
```

### Manual Static Deployment (Advanced)

This is the harder alternative for servers where Docker cannot be used. The administrator must install and maintain Node.js, npm, Nginx or another static web server, firewall access, startup behavior, and future updates separately.

Requirements:

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- Nginx, Apache, Caddy, or another static web server

Create the static build on Linux or macOS:

```bash
npm ci
STATIC_EXPORT=true npm run build
```

Create it with PowerShell on Windows:

```powershell
npm ci
$env:STATIC_EXPORT = "true"
npm run build
Remove-Item Env:STATIC_EXPORT
```

The deployable files are generated in `apps/web/out`. Configure the web server to serve that directory and fall back to `index.html` for unknown application paths. [`deploy/docker/nginx.conf`](deploy/docker/nginx.conf) is the configuration used by the Docker image and can be adapted for a manual Nginx installation.

The administrator must also open the chosen LAN port in the server firewall and arrange for the web server to start automatically after a reboot. For each SketchForge update, pull the new source, install dependencies, rebuild `apps/web/out`, replace the served files, and reload the web server.

## Development

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Run TypeScript checks.

```bash
npm run build
```

Create a production build.

```bash
npm run export
```

Build with static export mode enabled.

## AI Scene Bridge (MCP)

This fork adds an **AI scene bridge** so an MCP server (driven by Claude) can push parametric 3D scenes straight into the running editor. Claude emits `WorkplaneShape` JSON; the editor renders it with the same Manifold/CSG pipeline used for hand-built shapes. Geometry stays client-side — the bridge only stages a command on disk that an in-page poller applies through the editor's existing save path, so the Node side never touches your browser project storage.

### Enable bridge mode

Start the app (`npm run dev`), then open the editor with the `bridge` flag and any project id:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/?bridge=1&project=my-first-scene
```

The project id does not need to exist yet — the first scene push creates and opens it. Reloading keeps the scene (it lives in browser storage), and an incoming push is deferred while you are dragging a shape.

### Connect the MCP server

The MCP server lives in [`apps/mcp/`](apps/mcp) and is registered for Claude Code in [`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json). Install its dependencies once, then restart Claude Code so it picks up the `sketchforge-scene-bridge` server and approve it when prompted:

```bash
npm install --prefix apps/mcp
```

It talks to the running app at `SKETCHFORGE_BASE_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:3000`). To run it standalone for an MCP inspector:

```bash
npm run start --prefix apps/mcp
```

### Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `list_kinds` | List shape kinds, default sizes, and example scenes. Call this first. |
| `set_scene` | Replace a project's scene (unknown ids are created automatically). |
| `add_shapes` | Append shapes to the current scene. |
| `get_scene` | Read the current scene back to iterate on it. |

With the app open in bridge mode, ask Claude for something like *"a 40 mm phone stand with a cable slot"* and the shapes appear in the workplane within a second; follow up with *"make the cable slot 5 mm wider"* to iterate. The full data contract, architecture, and design notes are in [`docs/scene-bridge/README.md`](docs/scene-bridge/README.md).

## Current Status

SketchForge is alpha, but the core editor loop is usable today:

- create and reopen local projects
- add, move, resize, rotate, mirror, align, duplicate, hide, and delete shapes
- switch shapes between solid and hole modes
- group and ungroup geometry
- import STL files
- export STL or OBJ
- generate project thumbnails

The next big areas are workflow polish, more geometry edge-case testing, stronger automated editor coverage, and better release documentation.

## Contributing
