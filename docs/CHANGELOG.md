# Changelog

## 1.0.6

- Fixed dense STL imports failing with `Invalid string length` while creating their initial undo-history fingerprint.
- Streamed large numeric mesh arrays into deterministic hashes instead of converting millions of coordinates to one oversized JSON string.

## 1.0.5

- Made the rotation handles larger and aligned their arrow glyphs with the model faces as the camera moves, including stable behavior on long objects.
- Positioned the lower rotation handle consistently at the model base and corrected its visual and drag directions.
- Added an optional **Select before moving** workspace setting so the first click selects an object without immediately dragging it.

## 1.0.4

- Fixed imported STL objects briefly appearing and then vanishing when a stale IndexedDB project read completed after the import.
- Prevented older persisted project data from overwriting newer live editor state during asynchronous project hydration.

## 0.1.0

- Initial open-source alpha.
- Browser-based 3D workspace with primitive shape editing.
- STL import and STL/OBJ export.
- Grouping and hole subtraction workflows.
- Local project dashboard with generated thumbnails.
